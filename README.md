Final project submission for the ConsenSys Academy Blockchain Developer Bootcamp 2021

## Project idea:

`tl;dr`: Validator for vaccination certficate

`longer version`: 
In these times but also others to follow, we need a way to validate whether a vaccination certificate issued is actually legitimate or not, in a trustless environment. 

### Concept
The interface has 2 modes:
- one for registering the certificate and
- one for validating it.

#### Registering
As soon as one has their vaccination QR code, they will enter it in the Blockchain, along with their first and last name.

#### Confirming
Similar to the app in Fig.1, the reverse process is going to be used to verify the validity of the QR code, in accordance with the ID that the person is going to be holding.
